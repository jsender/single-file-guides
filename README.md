### Single File Guides
This repository is destined to hold single-file documentations, guides and tutorials of things that aren't specific projects (since those can simply have wiki page and also, downloading single files is more convenient than getting whole wiki from the web).

Anyone can become contributor and hold docs, tutorials and guides here, as long they are in a single file and contain links and sources of knowledge used in the content.
